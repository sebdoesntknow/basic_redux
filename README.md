The most basic Redux implementation
===================================

##### This is just for learning purposes, to understand what Redux does in its core. The information displayed here was extracted from
[The Complete Redux Book](https://leanpub.com/redux-book).

I **strongly** suggest people interested in learning Redux to get that book (and it's free! :))

## Setup

* Edit the index.js file under <PROJECT_ROOT>src/index.js
* After you are done with your modifications run `yarn build`
* Open the generated index.js under <PROJECT_ROOT> in your browser

It is just a counter, there's no fun in a counter so build your own thing!

*The most important thing is to check the source code, read the comments and understand
what's going on with this implementation.*
